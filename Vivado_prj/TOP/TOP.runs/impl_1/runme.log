WARNING: [DRC REQP-1839] RAMB36 async control check: The RAMB36E1 TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_0 has an input control pin TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_0/ENARDEN (net: TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_0_i_1_n_0) which is driven by a register (TFT_top6/TFT_driver3/byte_addr_reg[17]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

WARNING: [DRC CHECK-3] Report rule limit reached: REQP-1839 rule limit reached: 20 violations have been found.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net Sense_top6/sonic_digital3/sel_reg[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Sense_top6/sonic_digital3/sel_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell Sense_top6/sonic_digital3/sel_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net TFT_top6/TFT_driver3/clka is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin TFT_top6/TFT_driver3/clka_INST_0/O, cell TFT_top6/TFT_driver3/clka_INST_0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT TFT_top6/TFT_driver3/clka_INST_0 is driving clock pin of 131 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_0, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_1, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_2, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_3, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_4, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_5, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_6, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_7, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_10_0, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_10_1, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_10_2, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_10_3, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_10_4, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_10_5, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_10_6... and (the first 15 of 131 listed)
WARNING: [DRC REQP-1839] RAMB36 async control check: The RAMB36E1 TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_0 has an input control pin TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_0/ADDRARDADDR[0] (net: TFT_top6/single_ROM22/addr[0]) which is driven by a register (TFT_top6/TFT_driver3/byte_addr_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
