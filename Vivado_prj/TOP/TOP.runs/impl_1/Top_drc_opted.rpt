PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT TFT_top6/TFT_driver3/clka_INST_0 is driving clock pin of 131 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_0, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_1, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_2, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_3, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_4, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_5, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_6, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_7, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_10_0, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_10_1, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_10_2, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_10_3, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_10_4, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_10_5, TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_10_6 (the first 15 of 131 listed)

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_0 has an input control pin TFT_top6/single_ROM22/q_reg_0_0/ADDRARDADDR[0] (net: TFT_top6/single_ROM22/addr[0]) which is driven by a register (TFT_top6/TFT_driver3/byte_addr_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
